				<h2><strong>What is Electro-Dermal Scanning (EDS) or Meridian Stress Assessment (MSA)?</strong></h2>
		<p><img src="images/000_0003d.jpg" style="float: left;" alt=""></p>
		<p>Meridian Stress Assessment (MSA) is used to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of a person's energetic health and balance. This process involves measuring electrical conductivity at responsive points (meridian points) on the skin - typically on the hands and feet. The locations of the test points generally correspond to those of acupuncture points. These measurements are recorded to help provide a profile of a client's present condition.</p>
		<p>The information gathered through electro-dermal scanning is monumental in evaluating how your body is handling internal and external stressors such as daily life stress, digestion of food, elimination of toxins, etc. Healthy balance in our lives is so important and so difficult to obtain in this crazy "fast everything" society. Finally, an affordable approach to wellness...how much better could your life be?</p>
		<p>Proverbs 3:7-8 - "Do not be wise in your own eyes; fear the Lord and shun evil.  This will bring health to your body and nourishment to your bones."</p>


		<h2><strong>EDS Philosophy</strong></h2>
		<p><img src="images/msas_pro_1.jpg" style="float: right;" alt=""></p>
		<p>According to European medical research, acupunture points are related to the body's organs and organ systems. Major groups of points are connected through channels, or meridians. Twenty of these meridians begin or end on the hands and feet, such as the heart, liver, lungs, kidneys, etc.</p>
		<p>As a client moves toward or away from health, the condition of any particular organ or system can be sensed along the meridians at representative points. As a result, stress associated with the corresponding organs can be surveyed using the indicated points.</p>
		<p>After the initial measurements have been taken and recorded, the results can be reviewed. If stress values are above or below equilibrium, the System's extensive computer database will allow consideration of a wide range of possibilities that might help the patient regain a healthy balance. The MSAS allows consideration of thousands of herbal, homeopathic, and nutritional products.</p>
		<p>Overall, the MSAS provides a completely non-invasive method for gaining valuable information about the body's vital functions. The primary objective of this procedure is to disclose patterns of stress and to provide feedback for use in a program to help restore each system and meridian to an appropriate balance.</p>
		<p>The MSAS meridian stress assessment system does not provide a medical diagnosis. If clients suspect that they need medical intervention, they should consult their physicians who can provide medical diagnosis and prescribe appropriate treatment regimens.</p>
		<p>The MSA system provides extraordinary new perspective on the state of the body's energetic health.  With BioMeridian's MSAS-Professional System, a practitioner may choose to use the information gathered to determine the next step in a client's health care.</p>

		<h2><strong>What does EDS scanning do?</strong></h2>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>Non-invasive sensitivity screening. No scratch testing or injections are necessary.</li>
				<li>Nutritional evaluations can help clients who are looking for nutritional balance.</li>
				<li>Consider possible complementary approaches that may help a client achieve a more balanced energetic state.</li>
				<li>Identify specific dental stressors that might contribute to health problems.</li>
				<li>Test for toxicity and drainage levels, and their effects on energy and organ functions.</li>
				<li>Help clients maintain the structural or functional integrity of important body systems.</li>
				<li>Suggest whether there is a condition present that may require traditional medical treatment.</li>
			</ul>
