				<h2><strong>What is Chiropractic?</strong></h2>
		<p>Chiropractic, although many times misunderstood, is about helping people live healthier, fuller lives. While typically thought of as "bone doctors", chiropractors actually focus on the nervous system and painlessly, manually adjust the vertebral column in order to effect the nervous system.</p>
		<p>According to Gray's Anatomy, the nervous system is the master system in the body and controls and coordinates all other systems such as respiratory, digestive, muscular, immune and so forth. The nervous system includes the brain, spinal cord, the spinal nerves that exit the vertebral column through openings on the sides of each vertebra, and all the peripheral nerves that branch off to serve organs, tissues, blood vessels, muscles etcetera. Information from the environment, both external and internal, goes through the spine to get to the brain. In the same manner, information and decisions made in the brain go through the spine to effect certain outcomes. It is a two-way flow of information.</p>
		<p>The intention of the chiropractic adjustment is to remove any disruptions or distortions of this energy flow that may be caused by slight vertebral misalignments that we call subluxations. Chiropractors are trained to locate these subluxations and then to remove them, thereby restoring the normal flow of nerve energy in terms of both quality and quantity. The idea is that if the master system, which is the nervous system, is healthy and functioning well, then the other systems under its control will also function in a more optimal fashion.</p>
		<p>Chiropractic is based on the belief that the same innate intelligence (God) that can grow a single cell into a complex human being, made of billions of cells, can also heal the body if it is free of disturbance to the nervous system. For example, if the area of spine that supplies nerve flow to the stomach is subluxated then information going to the brain regarding that organ and its function, digestion, will be distorted and the brain will not be receiving accurate data on its condition. Likewise, decisions made in the brain and conveyed along the nervous pathways will be disrupted and the correct responses will be unable to be made. It is essentially the same scenario for all other organs, muscles, blood vessels and so forth. When a chiropractor removes this interference, then the nervous system functions more optimally and the body is able to heal itself via the two-way communication system.</p>
		<p>The philosophy of chiropractic is that health, not merely the absence of symptoms, comes from within the body, not from the outside. It is the innate, or inborn intelligence (God) of our bodies, that does the healing. It is not the drugs, the surgeries or the physician/chiropractor that does the healing, but the healing power that God placed inside the body itself. It is the job and the great honor of the chiropractor to remove subluxations so that the power that made the body may heal the body.</p>
		<h2><strong>How will the Doctor correct the problem?</strong></h2>
		<p>Once a chiropractor finds that you do have subluxation, he/she will adjust your spine to correct the subluxation.  Chiropractors use many ways to adjust the spine but it is imperative that the adjustment be very specific.  You wouldn't want to go to a dentist and have him find a cavity then drill a hold in every tooth just to make sure he didn't miss the cavity.  At Valeo Health and Wellness Center, we have spent a lot of time learning techniques that are specific and scientific. </p>
		<h2><strong>What techniques do we use?</strong></h2>
		
		<p><h3><strong>Torque Release Technique:</strong></h3></p>
		<p>The main technique we use is Torque Release Technique (TRT), which primarily uses a hand held instrument called the Integrator.  The FDA has granted a 510K medical device designation to this instrument whose sole purpose is designed to correct the vertebral subluxation.  The Integrator is chiropractic's first adjusting instrument to receive an FDA clearance that has gone through a funded, independent randomized, clinical trial.</p>
		<p>The purpose of the study - a 1½-year long randomized clinical trial with 98 people, blinded and with placebo control - was to determine the outcomes that subluxation-based chiropractic care has in affecting the quality of life in the human population.  There were three specific results from the study.  One objective finding revealed a 100% retention rate for finishing addiction rehab treatment.  This 100% rate has never been accomplished by any other modality.  Another result was an improvement in depression that four weeks of chiropractic care surpassed what normally takes one year to achieve with standard medical model treatment.  And finally there was an improvement in anxiety that four weeks of chiropractic care surpassed what normally takes six months to achieve with the standard medical model. </p>
		
		<p><h3><strong>Gonstead Technique:</strong></h3></p>
		<p>We also use a manual technique called Gonstead.  Again, a very specific technique developed by Dr. Clarence Gonstead who practiced in Mount Horeb, WI.  People came from all over the world to see Dr. Gonstead.  He eventually had to build an airport and a hotel at his clinic to accommodate the travelers.  Millions of people worldwide have had life changing results from doctors of chiropractic who use Gonstead technique.

		<p><h3><strong>Webster Technique:</strong></h3></p>
		<p>The Webster technique is a specific analysis and adjustment used for pregnant mothers.  This chiropractic technique helps to correct sacral misalignments, balance pelvis muscles and ligaments, which in turn remove torsion to the woman's uterus, its resulting constraint to the baby, and allows the baby to get into the best possible position for birth.</p>
		
		<p><h3><strong>CranioSacral Therapy:</strong></h3></p>
		<p>CranioSacral Therapy (CST) is a gentle, hands-on method of evaluating and enhancing the functioning of a physiological body system called the craniosacral system - comprised of the membranes and cerebrospinal fluid that surround and protect the brain and spinal cord.</p>
		<p>Using a soft touch generally no greater than 5 grams, or about the weight of a nickel, practitioners release restrictions in the craniosacral system to improve the functioning of the central nervous system.</p>
		<p>By complementing the body's natural healing processes, CST is used as a preventive health measure for its ability to bolster resistance to disease, and is also effective for a wide range of medical problems associated with pain and dysfunction.</p>
		
		<h2><strong>What can I expect from TRT?</strong></h2>
		<p>Many people experience a tremendous sense of relaxation and well being after a TRT adjustment.  Most people take deep sighs after these adjustments as their bodies release deep neurological stresses that have been accumulating over the years.  Overall, it's always a very pleasant and enjoyable experience.</p>
		<p><b>I didn't feel or hear any noises or popping sounds when you adjusted me with TRT - did you really give me an adjustment?</b></p>
		<p>There's many ways of adjusting the spine.  Some involve a physical movement of the joint between two spinal bones, like Gonstead technique, resulting in the sound that people are so familiar with.  Other techniques use light force, like TRT, that do not cause any sound.  Both techniques work great!  It all comes down to the intent of the doctor in releasing stresses to your nervous system and the desire for healing within the patient.  We use a combination of techniques to provide you with the finest care possible.</p>
		
		<h2><strong>What types of conditions do you help?</strong></h2>
		<p>It's important to note that adjustments are not a treatment for specific diseases or conditions.  TRT, Gonstead, and Webster are meant to correct spinal subluxations that are interfering with the neurological control of your body.</p>
		
		<h2><strong>Are these techniques safe for infants and children?</strong></h2>
		<p>We have found that these techniques are the best ones we've seen for all ages of children - from birth through adolescence.  These techniques are extremely gentile, with no forceful movements of the spine.  Children really enjoy its gentleness and often hop onto the tables in anticipation of their spinal corrections!</p>
