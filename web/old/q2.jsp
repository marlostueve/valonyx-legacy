<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Georgia">Every time you use
the Q2 ENERGY Spa</font><font size="3" face="Georgia">, you are increasing your natural energy reservoir.
More importantly, you are empowering your body, mind and soul, each
of which forms part of us to make a whole.  One facet cannot function
nor be nurtured without the other as each relies on the other.
Numerous benefits have been reported after using the Q2 ENERGY Spa - such
as improved feelings of well-being, heightened mental awareness, and
clarity of thought, just to name a few.</font> <br></p>
<p align="justify"><img src="images/q2.jpg" style="float: left;" alt=""><font size="3" face="Georgia"><b>The Q2 ENERGY Spa </b></font><font size="3" face="Georgia"><b>:</b>
Created to realign, balance and enhance the bio energetic levels in
water that is then used by the cells of all living things.  We
live in a world in which water is the primary constituent of all life.
Not only does it serve as the medium in which all bio chemical processes
occur, but water also has the extremely important ability to convert
electro-magnetic energy (the energy coming from the Q2 System) into
Bio-energy.</font> </p> <br />
<h2><strong>How can the Q2 Help?</strong></h2>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Georgia">
The Q2 ENERGY Spa is the first patented hydro energetic system
to combine Q-Mechanics (based on Quantum Field Science) as an approach
to alternative holistic discipline.  With regular use of the Q2
ENERGY Spa your body will have much greater energy reserves to do what it knows
best, provide a greater ability to heal and maintain an optimum level
of well being.  By using the Q2 ENERGY Spa regularly, you (and your family) can increase
your energy levels whenever needed.  Healthy or not the benefits
of the Q2 ENERGY Spa can be an advantage to all.  The Q2 ENERGY
Spa is designed to address your needs for inner peace; your needs for new
strength; with renewed energy and spirit to handle the on-going and
continuous stresses of your daily life.  The very specific composition
and precise geometric configuration of the Array/Orb allows for the
generation of an exacting energetic signature.  This signature
is naturally converted by water into Bio-electric energy or "Bio Energy"
that can be utilized by any living thing.  Numerous locations around
the world are renowned to have rejuvenating and invigorating water sources.
There are well-known locations such as Lourdes in France and Baths in
England, and many less recognized sites where these waters contain tremendous
amounts of naturally occurring life energy.  This natural energy
is in essence a readily absorbable form of Bio-Energy which may be assimilated
by a living system when immersed into water.</font> <br></p>

<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Georgia">Contact with Bio-electrically
enhanced water is a great alternative for those who cannot have regular
access to naturally occurring sources. The Q2 ENERGY Spa is
in use by thousands of people around the world who are enjoying these
same properties of water in the comfort and privacy of their own homes.
Q-Tech Laboratories is the first to utilize non-invasive energetic therapy
technology to provide the ultimate hydro-therapeutic experience.  </font><a href="http://www.qenergyspa.com/" target="_blank"><font color="#0000FF" size="3" face="Georgia"><b><u>http://www.qenergyspa.com</u></b></font></a><font size="3" face="Georgia"><b><u>. </u></b></font> <br></p>
