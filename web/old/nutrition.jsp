				<h2><strong>Nutrition</strong></h2>
<p><font size="3" face="Georgia">"We have drifted into this deplorable
position of national malnutrition quite inadvertently.  It is the
result of scientific research with the objective of finding the best
ways to create foods that are non-perishable that can be made by mass
production methods in central factories, and distributed so cheaply
that they can sweep all local competition from the market.  Then,
after there develops a suspicion that these "foods" are inadequate
to support life, modern advertising steps in to propagandize the people
into believing that there is nothing wrong with them, that they are
products of scientific research intended to afford a food that is the
last word in nutritive value, and the confused public is totally unable
to arrive at any conclusion of fact, and continues to blindly buy the
rubbish that is killing them off years ahead of their time."  </font> <br>

<p align="center"><font size="5" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>Natural
vs. Synthetic Vitamins</u></b></font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">What is the difference between
Natural and synthetic?</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">In short, it's the difference
between something that's living and something that's dead.  </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">That's a big difference.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>Natural Whole Food Vitamins:  </b></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">On vitamin labels the word
"natural" has no specific definition other than that the substance
exists somewhere on the planet or in outer space.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The key words to look for are
"Whole Food Vitamins" - this means vitamins as they are found
in food, untampered-with in any way that would change their molecular
structure, their biological or biochemical combination, or their actions.</font> <br>
</p>
<p align="center"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Vitamins in
their natural state always exist as living complexes with specific synergistic
co-factors, enzymes, phytonutrients and organic mineral-activators,
and never as isolated single factors.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"><b><i>A vitamin
needs all of its synergists to function!</i></b></font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Further, there
are literally hundreds of such synergists, most of which have not yet
been studied but are nevertheless very important.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Organic food sources are preferred
since they are more nutrient-dense and contain no pesticide residues.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>CRYSTALLINE</b> means that
a natural food has been treated with various chemicals, solvents, heat
and distillations to reduce it down to one specific "pure" crystalline
vitamin.  In this process all the synergists, which are termed
"impurities," are destroyed.  There is no longer anything natural
in the action of crystalline "vitamins" - they should more accurately
be termed drugs.  </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>SYNTHETIC</b> means that
a chemist attempted to reconstruct the exact structure of the crystalline
molecule by chemically combining molecules from other sources.
These sources are not living foods, but dead chemicals.  For example,
Vitamin B1 is made from a coal tar derivative, and d-alpha tocopherol
(so-called Vitamin E) is a byproduct of materials used by the Eastman
Kodak Company to make film.  However, it is not legally necessary
to give the source from which the synthetic "vitamin" is derived.
Synthetic "vitamins" should more accurately be called drugs.</font></p>

<h1><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>How To Read a Vitamin Label</b></font></h1>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">To identify synthetics on the
label, look to see if a source is given.  If it isn't, assume
the product is synthetic.  These terms also identify a vitamin
as synthetic:</font> <br></p>
<ul><p><font size="3" face="Wingdings">Ø</font><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">
Acetate </font><font size="3" face="Wingdings">Ø</font><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Whole-food natural supplements
never come in high dosages.  It is only possible to create high-dosage
"vitamins" if you isolate one fraction of the vitamin complex as
in crystalline, or synthesize one fraction as in synthetics.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Look at Vitamin C and Vitamin
E diagrams.  In naturally-occurring Vitamin C Complex, the ascorbic
acid portion comprises only about 5% of the whole complex.  Similarly,
alpha tocopherol only comprises a small percentage of Vitamin E Complex.  </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Legally, the only portion of
the Vitamin C Complex that is allowed to be called Vitamin C is the
ascorbic acid portion, and the only part of the Vitamin E Complex that
can be called Vitamin E is the alpha tocopherol piece.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>The Fallacy Of
"High Dosage Equals  High Potency"</b></font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">We, as consumers, have been
thoroughly fooled and misled about vitamins.  We have been hoodwinked
into believing that large <u>quantities</u> of <b><i>dead chemicals</i></b>
are more nutritionally potent than smaller amounts of <u>high-quality</u> <b><i>
living compounds</i></b>.  </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Relatively small amounts of
whole-food naturally vitamins, with all of their naturally-occurring
synergists, are far more potent than high doses of synthetic imitation
"vitamins."</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>Do Synthetic Vitamins Function
as Well as Natural Whole-Food Vitamins?</b></font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">No one would argue that high-performance,
complex mechanisms like computers or space shuttles require very specific,
high-quality materials in their makeup.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Living systems are even more
complex and specific in their need for building materials.  In
addition, living systems are constantly breaking down cells, organs
and tissues, and rebuilding and repairing them.  For these processes
the body must have a continual supply of high-quality material.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">If you build a house with cheap,
imitation construction materials, your house will quickly fall into
disrepair.  The same is true for the physical body.  The body
has a very precise design, which is so incredibly intricate and complex
that even with all the scientific and medical research thus far, we
have only scratched the surface of understanding it.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">What arrogance it is to think
that we can alter a design we don't even understand.</font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>In Summary: </b></font> <br>

repair and rebuild a living body with dead chemicals
- It simply isn't possible!</i></b></font> <br> <br>

<p align="center"><font size="5" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>Foods

&amp; Supplements</u></b></font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">"Nature does not produce
vitamins, minerals, trace minerals, or any other food components in
concentrated or segregated forms, but merges and blends them - synchronizes
them - for the body's needs.  The idea that "if a little
is good, more is better" leads to ingestion of mega doses of "high
potency", refined, separated, "nutrients", dismantled, disassembled,
or artificially manufactured chemical supplements.  This will "work"
for a short time - pharmacologically stimulating or suppressing.
Eventually, this method backfires and causes complications, imbalances.
The body works to eliminate the excess and what it perceives as foreign,
non-food.  It attempts to combine the isolated chemical and other
members of the complex, which normally appear in food, taking rather
than giving.  Such supplements do not contribute to health they
only disrupt it.  Balance and function - not quantity - are the
keys."  </font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">"The assumption that human
technology could improve on the wisdom of Nature has become a primary

and label them as "active ingredients."  In fact it is the
symphony of nutrients working synergistically that provides the quantum
healing power of whole foods."  </font></p>
