				<h2><strong>What is Functional Endocrinology - Hormonal Balance?</strong></h2>
<p align="center"><font size="5" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>Hormones</u></b><b><u>
As Messengers</u></b></font></p>


<ul type="DISC">
  <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Hormones are biochemical
  messengers that exert profound and specific metabolic influences throughout
  the body.</font></li>
  <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The endocrine system
  produces a multitude of hormones that work together as a synergistic
  whole.</font></li>
  <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The endocrine system
  and the nervous system are the control systems of the body.</font></li>
  <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">When hormones become
  imbalanced, the biochemical symphony plays out of tune.</font></li>
  <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The endocrine system
  is probably the first system impacted by nutritional imbalances and
  deficiencies.  Nutrients are needed to make and replace hormones,
  and the metabolic functions performed by hormones are nutrient based
  and mediated.  For example, for a hormone to direct a cell to make
  an enzyme, nutrients are required to make the hormone, for the hormone
  to enter the cell, to stimulate the function, and then nutrients are
  required to make the enzyme, and release the enzyme to act.  </font></li>

  <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Another way of saying
  this is:</font></li>
</ul>
<p align="center"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>We are made
out of nutrients and ALL of our physiological functions require nutrients!</b></font></p>
<h2><strong>Hormones as Metabolic Keys</strong></h2>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Hormones function like two-ended
keys.</font></p>
<ul type="DISC">
  <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The R end, or receptor
  end, fits precisely into a cell receptor and "unlocks" the metabolic
  door to initiate an action.</font></li>
  <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The E end, or enzyme
  end, fits precisely with cellular enzymes that transform the hormone
  into another hormone, or into a metabolite for excretion. *</font></li>

</ul>
<h3 align="center"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>The problem
with synthetic "Hormones"</b></font></h3>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">When a synthetic "hormone"
enters the cell receptor, its R end is similar to the real one, but
not an exact fit.  Like the wrong key in a lock, this jams the
cell receptor or alters the action initiated.  </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>This is known as SIDE
EFFECTS</u>!</b></font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The synthetic "hormone"
does not have the correct E end, so cannot be properly cleared from
the receptor, transformed into other hormones, or properly metabolized
and excreted.  </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>This is known as more
SIDE EFFECTS</u>!</b></font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">If you wish to disrupt the
delicately balanced Endocrine System, giving synthetic "hormones"
is an excellent way to do so.  The disruption is even more pronounced
with synthetic steroid "hormones" because the steroids have their
own delicately balanced melody within the overall symphony.</font> <br>
 <br> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>NOTE:  All steroid
hormones can be made in a bioidentical form to our own.  These
are easily and inexpensively made from plant sterols, usually from wild
yam or soy.  Being exact versions of human hormones, they cannot
be patented.  In addition:  Synthetic steroid
"hormones" are also made from plant sterols, and then chemically
altered by pharmaceutical companies so they can be patented.</i></font> <br>

<h2><strong>Advantages of Hormone Saliva Testing</strong></h2>
		<p>Research has demonstrated that the free hormone fraction predominates in saliva.  Hormones can be found free or bound to protein.  The free hormone fraction is very important to ascertain because it is the bioactive fraction that most significantly influences living cells.  The salivary female hormone levels correlate at 93% with the free hormones in the tissues.</p>
		<p>Hormones are powerful substances that control multiple functions throughout the body.  Hormone levels should be sufficient and balanced.  Too much or too little of them is not conducive to long-term emotional, mental and bodily health.</p>
		<p>Results for male and female natural hormones.  One, two, six or eight of them, depending on the need.  Utilization of your saliva as a sample for measuring hormones, such as Testosterone, DHEA, Progesterone, Estriol, Estrone, Estradiol, Dihydrotestosterone, and Androstenedione.</p>
		<p>Enable analysis of nutritional deficiencies and/or design whole food nutritional support to provide the body with the raw materials to nourish at the cellular level.</p>
		<p>Optimal health is dependent on the balance of hormones, not just a single hormone.</p>
