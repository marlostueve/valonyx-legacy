				<h2><strong>Kayle Vick | Chaska MN</strong></h2>
		<p>For more than a decade I've found myself living with weekly pains and irritations of muscle and back
aches. Like typical bodily symptoms, they would sometimes be better and other times worse... One thing
consistent however was that they were a regular occurrence.</p>
		<p>After two or three close friends mentioned their love of chiropractic care and how much of a difference
they noticed in their health, I decided I would go to a free consultation to see what they say.</p>
		<p>Within the first few minutes of Dr. Morland's talk on "Why Chiropractic," I was a believer. The simple
explanation of current medical practices and the field of chiropractic seemed like common sense to me.
I was anxious to see what would happen to my body receiving regular adjustments and I knew
something was about to change in my health - even before having anything done.</p>
		<p>Having now attended Valeo for 2 months, I can testify that it has been more than worth it! The staff, the
facility and most of all, the results of the adjustments have been life changing. My aches and pains are
85% gone and I haven't had to take any Ibuprofen! In addition, I've found myself becoming much more
aware of health and what our family is doing with food and exercise. I intend to get them into Valeo as
well!</p>
		<p>My body has quickly accepted the adjustments and the additional results have been more energy, deep
sleep for the first time in years, and an awareness and understanding of health and the body that no one
every taught me in school. I intend to pursue more on the nutritional path too in addition to just
chiropractic care.</p>
		<p>The Lord has clearly used Chiropractic care in my life on multiple levels and I will continue to be a
regular visitor, while urging others to stop in and inquire about their services</p>
		<h2><strong>Chris Carlson</strong></h2>
		<p>Let me start by saying that you have been such a blessing in my life and Duane's life! We appreciate all of the hard work you do and how you put yourself out there for each and every person that walks through your door. God is using you in miraculous ways!!</p>
		<p>Well here is our praise about what is happening with Duane. I don't know if you remember when he first came in to see you, but he had just been to see his doctor and was told his "bad" cholesterol was too high. It was at 118 and with his dad dying of a heart attack in his fifties, the doctor didn't want to mess around. He immediately prescribed medication and told him to come back in 6 months and they would recheck to see how things were going.</p>
		<p>Of course I wanted him to see you and reluctantly, skeptically, he did. He was saying just last night how he was amazed that after you did the scan you were able to tell that he didn't have a gall bladder, and had trouble digesting fats. He also had a pocket of fluid on his knee that he had drained twice and the doctor was recommending surgery. He didn't want to go on any meds and did not want any more surgeries and so this was an option he was willing to try. He would try it for 6 months. It ended up being a year. And then on Tuesday he went in for this recheck. </p>
		<p>The doctor asked how his body was handling the meds. Duane says just fine. "I decided not to take them and try some whole food supplements instead." His doctor seemed skeptical, but didn't really say anything. He wanted to see Duane's results. </p>
		<p>All that to say we got the results yesterday in the mail and his LDL cholesterol is now at 101!!! Down 17 points!! AND that pocket of fluid on his knee is gone as has not been back since. Praise God and thank you Christine for being in our lives. Duane was SO excited that everything was working just the way you said it would. He always talks about how great Dr. Aaron is and how good he feels because of the massages that he gets from Leah. And now he has added you to that list. He said he hasn't felt this good in a long, long time. </p>
		<p>Again, our heartfelt thanks to you for your service to us. We are truly blessed to know you. (and me to work with you) </p>
